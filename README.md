### Overview

A simple data table with item filtering, sorting, pagination, and removal. Built with React, Redux and ImmutableJS. Demo: http://lewisl9029.github.io/redux-data-table/

Note: This is only a demo app that I built over the weekend as a part of the interview process at a company I was applying to. It's not yet ready to be used as an external component (I'll take some time to clean this up and publish on npm in the near future).
